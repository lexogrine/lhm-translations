It means that you don't need to create a custom HTTP server with a parser just to receive information from supported games (CS2, Dota 2), you have all that out of the box, so you can focus on integrations and features you want to create.\nUpgrade your LHM to a Personal, Professional or Enterprise plan to get full access to this section.",
